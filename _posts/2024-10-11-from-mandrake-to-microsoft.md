After a few solid days working on my latest project — this Windows Setup script — I found myself asking, *How did we get here?*

I mean, I was one of the "good guys." I used Linux for most of my adult life! I still remember the day I picked up a Mandrake Linux CD from a tech magazine in Brazil, feeling like I'd unlocked the secrets of the universe. Rushed home, popped it into the family PC… and promptly destroyed the poor thing. But hey, that's how it goes when you're on the cutting edge, right?

That didn't stop me. Soon, I was running Kurumin (a Brazilian version of Knoppix) straight from a live CD, like a pro. For months, I tinkered with it, too scared to actually install it again. But the thrill of having control over everything was irresistible. Linux felt like a new frontier. It was a little rebellious, a little hacker-like, and it made me feel cool — like I had the keys to the digital kingdom. Simba on Pride Rock, but instead of ruling over lions, I ruled over packages, processes, and the occasional kernel panic.

I still love Linux. I really do. But after 25 years in IT, I think I might just be… tired. I've spent years hunting down drivers, reading through forum posts, and troubleshooting until the wee hours of the night. I mean, I've basically memorized `lsusb`, `lspci`, and `lshw` at this point.

These days, I find myself needing things to just work. You know? Plug it in, turn it on, and get stuff done. Maybe that's age talking, but after two decades of hacking around, I think I've earned a little convenience.

And so, here I am. Writing scripts to make Windows work for me. Yes, Windows. The platform I once ran from is now my daily driver, and honestly? It's not so bad! In fact, it's pretty great. Sure, it's not the wild open plains of Linux, but it's stable, functional, and — dare I say — kind of enjoyable to work with.

This project is my way of blending the best of both worlds. I get my old Linux love of automation and customization, but with the ease of a system that just works out of the box. It feels like I've come full circle — from the days of breaking my PC with Mandrake to making Windows work exactly how I want.

And I'm excited about what's next. Maybe it's not where I thought I'd end up, but it feels like the right place to be. After all, the future isn't about choosing sides; it's about making the most of the tools we have, wherever they come from.
